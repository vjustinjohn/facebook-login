From my previous tutorial you already learned how to setup and develop iframe base facebook page application. I named this tutorial iAdvance, because In this tutorial I’ll describe some more advance features but I’ll skip some parts those I already described in my previous tutorial.

Facebook provides some api to access user data and to access this data user must have to authorized your application. Otherwise you can’t call facebook api to get user data. Though facebook sends very minimal user data when user will visit your page app.

In this tutorial I’ll explain:

    How to add authentication feature in your page app using php sdk
    How to provide extended permissions list in the authorization page
    How to use graph api to get user’s data & update user’s status
    How to use FQL query
    How to parse signed_request sends by facebook
    How to detect if user liked your facebook page or not
